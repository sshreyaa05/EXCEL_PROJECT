### Store Sales Data Analysis & Annual Report 2022

In this Excel-based project, I analyzed a retail store's sales data for the year 2022 to create a comprehensive Annual Sales Report aimed at improving profitability in future years. The project involved multiple stages, starting with data cleaning to remove inconsistencies and prepare the dataset for analysis. I then enhanced the data by creating new columns such as 'Month' (to analyze monthly trends) and 'Age Group' (to segment customers by demographic).

Using Excel's analytical tools such as PivotTables, charts, and formulas, I conducted detailed analysis to identify key patterns in sales performance across products, time periods, and customer segments. I summarized these findings in a dynamic dashboard report that visualizes critical metrics including monthly sales trends, top-performing products, sales by age group, and customer buying behavior.

The analysis revealed actionable insights, such as peak sales months, high-revenue customer demographics, and underperforming categories, which can help guide strategic decisions to boost profitability in future years.
